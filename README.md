TRAFFIC SIGN DETECTION USING FUZZY NEURAL NETWORK

This project combines fuzzy logic and neural networks to improve the accuracy and robustness of traffic sign detection systems. Below is a concise preview or overview of such as:

üìò Abstract Preview
Traffic sign detection is essential for autonomous driving and driver assistance systems. Traditional computer vision approaches often struggle with issues like poor lighting, occlusions, or sign degradation. This project introduces a hybrid method that combines fuzzy logic's human-like reasoning with the adaptive learning capabilities of neural networks.

The Fuzzy Neural Network (FNN) model allows for better handling of uncertainty and imprecision in image data. The system detects and classifies traffic signs using:

Image pre-processing (contrast adjustment, noise filtering)

Feature extraction (shape, color, edge)

Fuzzy logic inference for ambiguity resolution

Neural network training for classification

This intelligent fusion results in a more accurate and context-aware traffic sign detection system.
